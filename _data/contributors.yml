synatra:
  name: Dr. Synatra Smith
  bio: is a Black eXpeRience researcher and sits at the intersection of researcher; gallery, library, archives, and museum (GLAM) professional; and digital humanities practitioner. In her postdoctoral fellowship she is exploring ways to bring extended reality (XR) tools into cultural preservation spaces as a mechanism for enhanced engagement with both physical and digital/virtual exhibitions. Storytelling and narrative-building are central to that experience and her goal is to identify ways to engage target user communities throughout the life of these projects through more inclusive means that integrate feedback loops and multiple intelligences. She is doing this work with the specific intention of documenting workflows that can be shared with students, cultural heritage workers, and scholars interested in building digital projects without relying on a large budget or team. Overall, she is eager to continue to advocate for the interest of institutions and individuals committed to the preservation of African-descended cultures and communities.
